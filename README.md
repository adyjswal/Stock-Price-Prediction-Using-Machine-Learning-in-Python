# Stock-Price-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-in-Python

Project Overview
This project aims to predict stock prices based on historical data, applying machine learning algorithms to learn patterns and trends in the data. With reliable forecasting, investors and analysts can make data-driven decisions to optimize their strategies.

Tech Stack
Python: Programming language
Pandas, NumPy: Data manipulation
Matplotlib, Seaborn: Visualization
XGBoost, scikit-learn: Machine Learning
Algorithms
k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN): for similarity-based predictions.
XGBoost: a gradient-boosted decision tree algorithm for complex, non-linear modeling.
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Data Collection
Historical stock data can be downloaded from Yahoo Finance or other reliable financial data sources.
Usage
Load Data: Ensure that the historical stock data is in the correct format.
Preprocess Data: Handle missing values and calculate features.
Train Model: Execute the train_model.py script to train the machine learning model on stock data.
Predict: Run predict.py to generate stock price predictions.
Model Evaluation
The models are evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) metrics.
Results
Model performance visualizations are included to compare actual vs. predicted stock prices.
Future Work
Enhancing feature engineering by adding more technical indicators.
Implementing additional algorithms like LSTM for improved time-series prediction.
